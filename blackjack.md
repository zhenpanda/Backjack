### The game

[Blackjack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is a one player game where people down on their luck generally transform their lives.  It's probably a thing in your universe, but feel free to read up on it if you have to.

## Project Details

### Basic features

A basic implementation of this project must include:

1. A way to keep track of the current player bankroll
2. A way for players to make a bet
3. A way for players to get more cards, or declare themselves happy with their current hand
4. A way for players to bust
5. A way for players to win or tie
6. Game logic for the dealer to hit until a certain point

###  Advanced features

Going above and beyond the basic implementation is desirable, should you have the time.  Feel free to enhance your project with any of the following features:

1. A button on `game over` to reset the game back to initial state
2. A way for players to 'split' a hand
3. A way for players to 'double down' on a hand
4. Appropriate handling of 'insurance' and dealer blackjack

## Implementation

### Technologies

You will be expected to use the following technologies to implement this project:

- **HTML**  
  Your HTML should be semantic.

- **CSS**

- **JavaScript & jQuery**  
  Your game should be playable *and* responsive.

### Timeframe

## Deliverables

By the time the project is over, we will expect the following from you:

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app** (at least one)
