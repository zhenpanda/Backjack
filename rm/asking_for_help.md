# How to Ask Questions on Github
In order to receive help on an issue you are having during your development process you must submit a **Github Issue** for your project.
Below is a guide for the information that must be included when submitting an issue.
It is expected that you will try to debug/solve an issue _prior_ to submitting a request for help on Github.

- What User Story you are currently working on
- What you are trying to do
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors, screenshots
- Gems and/or other technologies being used

### What have you tried?
Give information about what you have done to solve the problem. Including but not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
- Steps you have taken to solve the problem
